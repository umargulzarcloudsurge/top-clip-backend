## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Cookies
```bash
# On your Windows machine, copy to server:
scp youtube_cookies.txt YOUR_USERNAME@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/tmp/new_cookies.txt

# SSH to your Ubuntu server:
ssh YOUR_USERNAME@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# On Ubuntu server:
sudo cp /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt.backup
sudo mv /tmp/new_cookies.txt /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt
sudo chown www-data:www-data /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt
sudo chmod 644 /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt
```

### Step 2: Verify Cookies
```bash
# Check file exists and has content:
head -5 /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt
grep -c "youtube.com" /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt  # Should show 16

# Test with yt-dlp:
yt-dlp --cookies /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt --dump-json 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ' | grep title
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variable
```bash
# Check if environment variable is set:
echo $YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH
cat /etc/top-clip-backend/.env | grep YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH

# If not set, add to .env:
echo "YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH=/etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt" >> /etc/top-clip-backend/.env
```

### Step 4: Update Backend Code
```bash
# Copy updated YouTube downloader:
# (Upload the updated utils/youtube_downloader.py to your server)
```

### Step 5: Restart Backend
```bash
# Restart your backend service:
sudo systemctl restart your-backend-service-name

# Check logs for success:
sudo journalctl -u your-backend-service-name -f | grep -i cookie
```

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If you still see "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot":

1. **Check cookie file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt
   ```

2. **Check environment variable:**
   ```bash
   grep YOUTUBE_COOKIES_PATH /etc/top-clip-backend/.env
   ```

3. **Test cookies manually:**
   ```bash
   yt-dlp --cookies /etc/top-clip-backend/cookies.txt --list-formats 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'
   ```

4. **Check service environment:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl show your-backend-service --property=Environment
   ```

5. **Check backend logs for validation report:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u your-backend-service -n 100 | grep -A 20 "PREMIUM COOKIES VALIDATION"
   ```
