# Stripe Integration Technical Documentation

This document provides a technical overview of the Stripe integration fixes and enhancements implemented in the Topclip application.

## 1. Initial State of the Project

The project is a web application with a React frontend and a Python backend. The Stripe integration was partially implemented but had several issues preventing it from working correctly.

## 2. Identified Issues

- **Mismatched Stripe Keys:** The backend was configured with a test secret key and a live publishable key.
- **Incorrect Price IDs:** The frontend was using placeholder or incorrect Stripe Price IDs.
- **Environment Variable Mismatch:** The backend and frontend were using different environment variable naming conventions for Stripe Price IDs.
- **Environment Variable Syntax:** The frontend code was using Vite's `import.meta.env` syntax, while the project is a Create React App project that uses `process.env.REACT_APP_*`.
- **Unicode Errors:** The backend was throwing Unicode errors on Windows due to emojis in log messages.

## 3. Implemented Fixes and Enhancements

### 3.1. Backend

- **File:** `Backend-main/.env`
  - Unified Stripe keys to use test keys for both secret and publishable keys.
  - Added backend-specific Stripe Price ID environment variables (`STRIPE_HOBBY_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID`, etc.).

- **File:** `Backend-main/main.py`
  - Modified the logging configuration to handle Unicode characters gracefully by replacing emojis and ensuring UTF-8 encoding.

### 3.2. Frontend

- **File:** `Frontend-main/.env.development` & `Frontend-main/.env.local`
  - Updated the Stripe publishable key to the correct test key.
  - Replaced placeholder product IDs with the correct Stripe Price IDs.

- **File:** `Frontend-main/src/config/env.ts`
  - Ensured the configuration correctly loads Stripe Price IDs from the environment variables.

- **File:** `Frontend-main/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`
  - Corrected the environment variable access from `import.meta.env` to `process.env.REACT_APP_*`.
  - Integrated the pricing section with the `StripeContext` to use the existing `createCheckoutSession` function.
  - Ensured the correct price IDs are passed to the backend based on the user's selection (monthly/yearly).

## 4. Final State

The Stripe integration is now fully functional in the test environment. Users can upgrade their plans from the pricing section on the landing page. The system correctly handles both logged-in and logged-out users, directing them to the Stripe checkout page with the appropriate plan selected.

The environment variables are now consistent and correctly configured for both the backend and frontend, and the code is free of the previously identified bugs.
